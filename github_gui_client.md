## GitHub GUI Client

There are several ways to interact with GitHub, including through their website at https://github.com or a Git Command-Line Interface (CLI). However, for those who are new to the Git version control system, using a Git GUI client is a good starting point. Below are two options to consider:

### GitHub Desktop

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) is a valuable resource for beginners to learn the basics of Git version control. Its user-friendly interface makes common Git tasks, such as cloning repositories, committing changes, and pushing code to remote repositories, simple and straightforward. Additionally, it offers the following benefits:

- A visual interface for tracking changes to your code, providing a comprehensive view of a project's history and who made modifications and when.
- Integration with GitHub Issues and Pull Requests, making collaboration and tracking changes to your code easier.

For further assistance in getting started with GitHub Desktop, the [GitHub Desktop documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) is available for reference.

### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio (VS) Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) integrates seamlessly with GitHub through the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github). This extension enables you to review and manage your GitHub pull requests and issues directly within the VS Code editor.

One of the main advantages of using Visual Studio Code and GitHub together is the ability to review and manage your code repositories without leaving the code editor, bringing your version control workflows closer to your code.

To use GitHub in VS Code, you need to install [Git (CLI)](https://git-scm.com/downloads) as well as the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github).
