  - Slide 4: Discussed and maped the [4-layer architecture](./software_engineering_4-layer_architecture.md) to elements of the team project.
      - **Focus on Quality**: Reliability, testing, maintainability, requirements managements.
      - **Process**: Agile development, or any software development life cycle.
      - **Methods**: For this course, OOP design principles will be core. Methods will be the major part of the remaining of the course.
      - **Tools**: This is our current focus.  GitHub projects, issues, source control, actions, etc.  Although the process is referred to as the "glue", in my practical experience, tools are tightly coupled to the process and seriously impede progress.
  - Slide 5: Reinforced that the agile methodology does not prescribe that the artifact of each iteration is a production version, just functional. We talked briefly about CI and CD.  CI refers to Continuous Integration and CD refers to Continuous Delivery, as well as Continuous Deployment.  As part of this course we will work toward operating some of the Continuous Integration principles, but not Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment.
  - Slide 6: Introduce Agile Unified Process, which is yet another agile methodology.  This is being used to illustrate that the teams are very much in the Inception phase, currently working through the Elaboration phase, and progressing rapidly (if not starting) the Construction phase.  This is only being introduced as the construct should resonate with the realities of this team based project.
  - Slide 7: Discussed immediate expectations, and reinforced that start this week your grade depends on adhering to the following:
      - product manager
      - Be managing the product development through a GitHub Project
      - Have a managed and maintained product backlog-
      - Have an iteration backlog the defines the development work for the iteration
      - Have a defined cadence for team check-in (weekly minimum)
      - Have an issue for every activity
          - Issues are written in a clear and concise manner, and are actionable
          - Issues are assigned to individuals
          - Issues are labeled
          - Issue comments contain all discussion
          - All commit messages reference an issue
      - Be using a separate repository for each product component
      - **Note**: Every artifact (code, document) in the GitHub repository must be linked to an issue.
  - Slide 8:
      - The team project grade will be weighted equally across 4 criteria: Focus on Quality, Process, Methods, and Tools.
      - The **individual** project grade will include an individual contribution factor in the range of [0.7, 1.0]
      - Reminded that the course grade is weighted 60% project, 40% assignments.  This change was due to putting more emphasis on the project, resulting in the removal of the final exam.
