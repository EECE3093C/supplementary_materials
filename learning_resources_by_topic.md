# Learning Resources for EECE3093C Spring Semester 2023

This document contains learning resources organized by topic.

### Dev Containers

We will incorporate containerization through the use of Visual Studio Code Dev Containers only.  The expectation is that any repo can be downloaded, and through Visual Studio Code Dev Containers, you are guarnteed to have a consistent development environment.  Containerization **must be done** through Dev Containers.

### Git Branching Strategy

My preference is that you use a per developer branching strategy, where each developer has their own dev branch that is named `dev-[lastname]` (e.g., dev-margeson, dev-cimini).  An alternative you may consider is a per issue branching strategy.  This is where each task or issue has its own dev branch, such as `dev-issue-1`, `dev-issue-2`, `dev-issue-3`, etc.  The final option I would consider would be the feature branching strategy, where each feature in development has its own dev branch.  By feature we mean a discrete feature, such as `dev-frontend-scaffolding`, `dev-frontend-menu`, `dev-frontend-authentication`, etc.

### GitHub Actions


### GitHub Project and Issues

Every team must have a single GitHub Project created from the `Feature` project template.  

- You must actively maintain a [product backlog](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/backlogs).
- You must clearly demonstrate per iteration planning, and have an overall objective of what working software will be delivered for that iteration.
- During iteration planning (or prior), issues must:
  - be assigned to the [iteration](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/understanding-fields/about-iteration-fields)
  - be assigned to a developer
  - classified by assigning a label
- Team discussions about an issue must be captured through issue comments.

> **Warning**
> 
> All work done by all team members must be accounted for through issues.  If it is not an issue, you **cannot** get credit for the work.  Therefore, even researching a particular concept should be documented as an issue, what you learn and the outcome must be captured in a comment (on the issue).
