The 4-layer architecture of software engineering.  Overall, these four layers work together to help software development teams deliver high-quality, reliable software in a timely and efficient manner.

### Focus on Quality

This layer is concerned with ensuring that the software being developed meets the desired quality standards. This includes both functional and non-functional aspects of the software. Some examples of quality considerations are:

- Reliability: Can the software operate without errors, and consistently produce correct results?
- Security: Does the software adequately protect against unauthorized access and data breaches?
- Usability: Is the software easy to learn and use for its intended audience?
- Performance: Can the software handle its expected load and respond quickly to user inputs?
- Maintainability: Can the software be easily modified and extended over time?

### Process 

This layer deals with the management of the software development process, from planning to delivery. A good development process should be flexible, scalable, and repeatable. Examples of processes include:

- Agile: A set of iterative and incremental software development methodologies that prioritize customer collaboration, working software, and flexibility.
- Waterfall: A more traditional, linear approach to software development, where each stage of the process (e.g., requirements, design, coding, testing) is completed before moving on to the next.
- DevOps: A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve the speed and reliability of software delivery.

### Methods

This layer involves the selection and application of appropriate development methodologies and practices to achieve the desired outcomes. Some examples of methods include:

- Object-oriented programming: A programming paradigm that uses objects to represent data and behavior, and focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Test-driven development: A software development process where automated tests are written before any code is written, and code is continually tested and refactored as it is developed.
- Continuous integration: A software engineering practice where team members regularly integrate their work into a shared repository, and automated builds and tests are run to detect integration issues early.

### Tools

This layer concerns the selection and use of appropriate tools and technologies to support the development process. Examples of tools include:

- Integrated development environments (IDEs): Software applications that provide a comprehensive environment for writing, testing, and debugging code.
- Version control systems (VCSs): Software tools that manage changes to source code over time, allowing multiple team members to collaborate on the same codebase.
- Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tools: Platforms that automate the building, testing, and deployment of software to production environments.
